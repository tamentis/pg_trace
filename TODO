 - check for postgres version.
 - run on openbsd, create a port.
 - create the debian package crap.
 - hunt leaks, plenty of them.
 - interpret the content of read/writes?
 - guess the position in a table based on chunks (.1, .2 etc.)
 - capture in hex, and decode if needed (read/write) instead of playing the
   escape game.
 - what happens if pg writes pg_filenode while we read it.
 - don't die if you're not root.
 - make it work with struss (OS X).
 - make it work with ktrace (obsd).
 - fix debugging (not clear what does what, what outputs what)
 - pass through (s)trace calls
 - progress mode (curses? show the currently opened tables and how much they
   are being used, how far we are in the lseek?)
 - understand table inheritance?
 - two get and cache mechanisms: fd->filename, oid/filenode->relname, let's
   clarify the code around this.
 - also put the relmap in rn_cache?
 - only run lsof update at start, only rely on open/close after that.
 - only refresh the rn_cache if we see a write on pg_class.
 - document the process a little...
