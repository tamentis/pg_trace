now!
----
- improve random_reads to keep a few fds open at the same time.
- skip . and .. in random_reads.
- you have to deal with two relmaps at the same time (local and shared).

doc
---
 - explain how this whole thing work in README.

trace
-----
 - capture hex only and decode everything where appropriate, remove all the
   escape-dance code.
 - pass through (s)trace calls

postgres
--------
 - check for postgres version.
 - try to interpret the content of read-writes?
 - what happens if pg writes pg_filenode while we read it?
 - guess the position in a table based on chunks (.1, .2 etc.)
 - understand table inheritance? try to estimate how many tables were scanned
   as part of a parent-table scan
 - only refresh the rn_cache if we see a write on pg_class.
 - detect _fsm and _vm files and get the relname just as much, maybe with a suffix.

ui
--
 - progress mode (curses? show the currently opened tables and how much they
   are being used, how far we are in the lseek?)
 - if lsof is missing, just avoid pre-loading the pfd cache and start from
   scratch.
 - proper fail if the PID is not existing
 - proper fail if the PID disappears

code
----
 - check for more leaks (valgrind)
 - fix debugging (not clear what does what, what outputs what)
 - two get and cache mechanisms: fd->filename, oid/filenode->relname, let's
   clarify the code around this.
 - also put the relmap in rn_cache?

multi-platform
--------------
 - [openbsd] find a way to make it work with ktrace/kdump
 - [openbsd] make a port
 - [debian/ubuntu] make package
 - [mac] make it work with dtruss (OS X).
 - decide if we do the trace switches dynamically or in ./configure.
